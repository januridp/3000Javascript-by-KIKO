Have you given it a try yet?  This is what's called Foldertree navigation.  We think it's really neat, don't you?  If you like,  you may <a href="foldertree.zip" /foldertree/foldertree.zip">get the source code</a> (it's called Foldertree 1.3) directly from the <a href="javascript:if(confirm('http://www.geocities.com/Paris/LeftBank/2178/foldertree.html  \n\nYou must be connected to the Internet to access this link.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?'))window.location='http://www.geocities.com/Paris/LeftBank/2178/foldertree.html'" tppabs="http://www.geocities.com/Paris/LeftBank/2178/foldertree.html">author's site</a>.  (Note:  We do not offer the source code as it a much too complex script to offer Question & Answer support for.  And, all questions regarding this script should be directed to its <a href="javascript:if(confirm('http://www.geocities.com/Paris/LeftBank/2178/foldertree.html  \n\nYou must be connected to the Internet to access this link.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?'))window.location='http://www.geocities.com/Paris/LeftBank/2178/foldertree.html'" tppabs="http://www.geocities.com/Paris/LeftBank/2178/foldertree.html">author</a>.)
