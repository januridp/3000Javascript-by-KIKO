&lt;!-- THREE STEPS TO INSTALL RANDOM COMPUTER QUOTE:

   1.  Paste the coding into the HEAD of your HTML document
   2.  Copy the onLoad event handler into the BODY tag
   3.  Add the last code into the BODY of your HTML document  --&gt;

&lt;!-- STEP ONE: Copy this code into the HEAD of your HTML document  --&gt;

&lt;HEAD&gt;

&lt;SCRIPT LANGUAGE="JavaScript"&gt;

&lt;! &gt;
&lt;! &gt;

&lt;!-- Begin
function stClock() {

ar[1] = "2 + 2 = 5 for extremely large values of 2."
ar[2] = "Anything that can go wrong will go wrong."
ar[3] = "Computers make very fast, very accurate mistakes."
ar[4] = "My software never has bugs. It just develops random features."
ar[5] = "If anything simply cannot go wrong, it will anyway."
ar[6] = "Best file compression around: \"DEL *.*\" = 100% compression"
ar[7] = "The Definition of an Upgrade: Take old bugs out, put new ones in."
ar[8] = "If everything seems to be going well, you have obviously overlooked something."

var now = new Date()
var sec = now.getSeconds()

}
// End --&gt;
&lt;/SCRIPT&gt;

&lt;!-- STEP TWO: Add this onLoad event handler into the BODY tag  --&gt;

&lt;BODY onLoad="stClock()"&gt;

&lt;!-- STEP THREE: Put this code into the BODY of your HTML document  --&gt;
