quotes[3] = "You cannot do wrong without suffering wrong. (Ralph Waldo Emerson)";
quotes[4] = "Choose the way of life.  Choose the way of love.  Choose the way of caring...Choose the way of goodness.  It's up to you.  It's your choice. (Leo Buscaglia)";
quotes[5] = "The great successful men of the world have used their imagination...they think ahead and create their mental picture in all its details, filling in here, adding a little there, altering this a bit and that a bit, but steadily building-steadily buildings. (Robert Collier)";
quotes[6] = "Each time you are honest and conduct yourself with honesty, a success force will drive you toward greater success.  Each time you lie, even with a little white lie, there are strong forces pushing you toward failure. (Joseph Sugarman)";
quotes[7] = "The people who get on in this world are the people who get up and look for the circumstances they want, and, if they can't find them, make them. (George Bernard Shaw)";

quotes[20] = "Most successful men have not achieved their distinction by having some new talent or opportunity presented to them.  They have developed the opportunity that was at hand. (Bruce Barton)";
quotes[21] = "We don't need more strength or more ability or greater opportunity. What we need is to use what we have. (Basil S. Walsh)";
quotes[22] = "Destiny is not a matter of chance; it is a matter of choice.  It is not something to be waited for; but, rather something to be achieved. (William Jennings Bryan)";
