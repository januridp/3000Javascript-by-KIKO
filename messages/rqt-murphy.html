&lt;!-- THREE STEPS TO INSTALL RANDOM MURPHY'S LAW:

   1.  Paste the coding into the HEAD of your HTML document
   2.  Copy the onLoad event handler into the BODY tag
   3.  Add the last code into the BODY of your HTML document  --&gt;

&lt;!-- STEP ONE: Copy this code into the HEAD of your HTML document  --&gt;
